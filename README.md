## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Dynamic Artwork Display**: Showcase an array of images with intuitive navigation.
- **Customizable Layout**: Easily arrange elements using `Row` and `Column` composables.
- **Interactive UI**: Modify artwork states with simple button taps.
- **Jetpack Compose-Based**: Built with a declarative UI framework for a seamless user experience.
- **Offline Ready**: All photos and digital art are stored locally within the app.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The programming language for building the app.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for building modern, reactive UI.
- **Android Studio**: The development environment.

### Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are included in your `build.gradle` (app-level):

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.3.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.3.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling-preview:1.3.0"
    implementation "androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.5.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.foundation:foundation:1.3.0"

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-art-space.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Add your artwork or photos to the `res/drawable` directory.
4. Update the code to reference your images:
